# Scientific Cross-Algorithm Benchmark Evaluation: Visual Artifacts & Findings

This directory contains publication-ready comparison plots generated from Vagmin's verified benchmark suite on the **Edge-IIoTset** dataset across three independent trials (**Random Seeds 42, 43, and 44**).

## 1. Experimental Protocol & Execution Integrity

* **Common Evaluation Stream**: All comparable algorithms processed the identical **24,000 test observations** from `data/processed/test/test_*.csv` under common single-thread CPU affinity (`torch.set_num_threads(1)`).
* **Warm-up Isolation**: The first **1,000 records** were strictly designated as warm-up and excluded from all detection and computational metrics.
* **Feature Strictness**: All 62 input features were strictly non-label telemetry. `Attack_label` and `Attack_type` were never exposed to any model's `process()` pipeline.
* **Independent Calibration**: Thresholds were calibrated exclusively on validation data (`results/tables/threshold_calibration.json`) prior to test evaluation.
* **Error Bars**: Error bars represent the sample standard deviation ($s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$, with $N=3$ and `ddof=1`).
* **Hardware Environment**: 12-core / 16-thread x86_64 host (Intel Core i5-13500H), 15.69 GB RAM, CPU-only execution.

## 2. Capability Matrix & Scientific Fairness Boundaries

Placing algorithms with fundamentally disjoint capabilities on the same comparative axis produces scientifically invalid conclusions. The table below delineates the verified capabilities of each evaluated approach:

| Algorithm | Paper Reference | Streaming Detection | Causal RCA | Preemptive Migration | Closed-Loop FT | Valid Metric Plots |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Proposed Causal FT** | *Our Pipeline* | **Yes** | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | Detection, RCA, Computational, Reliability |
| **IPFT** | Theodoropoulos et al., 2022 | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | **Yes** | Detection, Computational, Mitigation |
| **BWOAIF** | Hannák et al., 2023 | **Yes** | No | No | No | Detection, Computational |
| **RCD** | Ikram et al., 2022 | No | **Yes** | No | No | RCA, Computational |
| **PreGAN** | Tuli et al., 2022 | **Yes** | No | **Yes** | **Yes** | Detection, Computational, Mitigation |

### Exclusion and N/A Rationale
1. **Why RCD is Excluded from Detection Performance**:
   RCD (*Robust Causal Diagnosis*, Ikram et al., 2022) is an offline root-cause diagnosis algorithm that takes known anomalous episodes and builds a localized causal graph. It does **not** perform online binary anomaly detection or output streaming anomaly scores. Assigning 0% precision or recall to RCD would be scientifically dishonest; it is designated as `N/A`.
2. **Why BWOAIF and RCD are Excluded from Mitigation/Recovery Plots**:
   Neither BWOAIF nor RCD implements closed-loop migration or recovery actions. They are marked `N/A` rather than 0% recovery latency.
3. **Why Accuracy and False-Positive Rate (FPR) are Not Plotted**:
   In strict accordance with the scientific mandate (*"Never hard-code, invent, estimate or manually alter metric values"*), Accuracy and FPR were not recorded in `full_benchmark_results.json` by `run_full_benchmark.py`. They are reported as `N/A (not recorded in benchmark trial output)` in summary tables.
